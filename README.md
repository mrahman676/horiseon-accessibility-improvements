# HTML & CSS re-structure for the Horiseon Web Page

## A re-structure to increase User Accessibility and Search Engine Optimisation

This is a landing page for a Digital Marketing Agency by the name Horiseon. The aim of restructuring the HTML structure of this page was to ensure all types users had the ability to absorb information about Horiseon's services from this page, and to ensure that the website was optimised it's search engine visibility. I completed this by:

* Replacing all non-semantic tags with appropriate semantic tags
* Adding descriptive content in place of images for users in case the image does not appear
*Adding comments to ensure future developers could identify where changes had been made
* Consolidated containers within the stylesheet for uniformity
